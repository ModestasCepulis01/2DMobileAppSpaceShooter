# 2DMobileAppSpaceShooter
A 2D based mobile app space shooter application made in Unity.

As the project is published in Google Play Store, 
it has all the ID's and all the personal data in the Unity Project Files, and I cannot publish the files to the public.

I have created a small presentation video that I'm going to be attaching to this repository.
If needed, the game can be accessed through the google play store:

Google play store URL:

The application was built as a part of a college assessment.
2D based mobile application that is released to public on the google play store under the name "Space Knights: Space Shooter"
All the textures were drawn by me using 2D drawing application 'Aseprite'.
